Chains+
     
   Craft Enhanced Chainmail which is actually worth using.
     
          This datapack adds the ability to turn normal chainmail into something that is actually useful.
     Crafting:
          Throw any set of chainmail, and Nether Star and a Totem on the ground together,
          and your Chainmail will be enhanced, your max health will be x2 with the armor on.  
     
     Installation: Extract files until you get a file called ChainsV1.x.ZIP and stick that zip in your datapacks folder.
     
     (Also, when wearing the chainmail on login you'll get 2 full health bars so you dont have to eat every login.)
     (Trouble Updating Versions? Install new version, delete old version, "/funtion chains:uninstall" and then "/reload")
     (Version 1.1- Used end crystal instead of nether star.)
