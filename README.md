Chains+
     
   Craft Enhanced Chainmail which is actually worth using.
     
          This datapack adds the ability to turn normal chainmail into something that is actually useful.
     Crafting:
          Throw a set of normal chainmail, and end crystal and a totem on the ground together,
          and you will recieve Chainmail which increases your max health x2.
          
     Can be Renamed or enchanted afterward.  
     
     (Also, when wearing the chainmail on login you'll get 2 full health bars so you dont have to eat every login.)
     (Trouble Updating Versions? Install new version, delete old version, "/funtion chains:uninstall" and then "/reload")
     
Thank you for checking out the pack!  
I hope you enjoy!  
Inspired by a Transaction in my other pack "Blockmart".
