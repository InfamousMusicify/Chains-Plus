Chains+
     
          This datapack adds the ability to turn normal chainmail into something that is actually useful.
     Crafting:
          Throw a set of normal chainmail, and end crystal and a totem on the ground together,
          and you will recieve Chainmail which increases your max health x2.
          
     Can be Renamed or enchanted afterward, also works with plated elytras.  
     but it wont transfer health attributes.
     
Thank you for checking out the pack!  
I hope you enjoy!  
Inspired by a Transaction in my other pack "Blockmart".
